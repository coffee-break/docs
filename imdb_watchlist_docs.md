# Imdb watchlist 

This is our initial idea. We are going to create an app that is connecting to your imdb watchlist and display movies 
which you can stream now from services like: nowtv.com, netflix, amazon prime. 

# Technical design

App will consist of this modules:

1. Frontend webapp
  - angularjs 2
  - webpack
  - material design
  - deployed using docker or just static files host (like gh pages)

Initial overview of angular 2 seeds [here](angular_seed_comparison.md)

2. Backend 
  - scala
  - akka
  - event architecture
  - deployed using docker

# Project management

Trello? - probably best for this.
