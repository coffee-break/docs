# Angular 2 seed projects

I've checked a few angular 2 seed projects, in order to decide which we can use as a base. 

## angular2-seed

[https://github.com/mgechev/angular2-seed](https://github.com/mgechev/angular2-seed)

Good:

* work without any problems with atom
* tests together with source files

Bad:

* jasmine instead of mocha and chai

## angular2 webpack - Angular Class

[https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter)

Bad:
* atom complains that some test files are not correctly connected it tsconfig
* tests in seperate test folder
* jasmine instead of mocha and chai
